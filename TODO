Items are in random order, mostly reverse chronological.

Top priority:

* Add a test harness for module-level testing..

* Consider using readline: replace calls to read() in frontend/engine.cc by calls to get_line(), the latter defined as in v5.08. Useful examples in the package examples directory. Those based on rl_callback_read_char can be interesting. See also http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_lib_readline.html.

* Clean and refurbish frontend new code: components.cc, engine.cc, etc.

* Add support for Chess Engine Communication Protocol version 2.

Normal priority:

* Evaluate the possibility to include an option 'enable/disable bigboard', to show a bigger board.

* 'pgnsave' will not save a file identical to the original in a sequence pgnload-pgnsave.

* 'manual' and 'force' are almost identical, except for the order they do things. See cmd.cc.

* 'name <myname>' forces output redirection to a log file. Comparing with version 5.08, some of the output is lost.

* Consider adding resign and draw offer commands.

* Add analysis tools for the evaluation function.

* Commands white/black/switch don't work. They are supposed to be 
used for icsDrone. However, icsDrone reports to not work for 
GNU Chess 5.02. Neither for v6...

* General cleanups: still some unused code from v5.

* Implement the weak mode.

* Improve compatibility with Chess Engine Communication Protocol.
For instance, 'move e2e4' instead of 'My move is : e2e4'.

* Add support for MS Windows.

* icsdrone for Internet

* When 'name NAME' is used, the log.nnn file is created, but it will miss
to include some information compared with v5.

* Consider using gnulib for better portability.

* Include PolyGlot's book making capability.

* Include PolyGlot's book merging capability.

* GA/EC venture to make the chess engine stronger.

* Get benefit from multiple-core processors, by sharing search across them.

* End-game table

* Bug: in FICS, after quiting in the middle of a game, logging in again,
accepting resuming game as proposed by opponent, the opponent moved but
GNU Chess never moved again. GNU Chess ran out of it.
