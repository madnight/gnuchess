Items are in random order, mostly chronological.

* General cleanups: still some unused code from v5.

* Transform all pieces of text doc into texinfo.

* GA/EC venture to make the chess engine stronger.

* Get benefit from multiple-core processors, by sharing search across them.

* End-game table

* Implement 'book *' commands. Only 'book add' is implemented at the moment.

* Provide v5 output of 'solve'.

* 'pgnsave filename.pgn' will not replace filename.pgn, but will append to it.
This is not supported by the PGN format. The file must be replaced, may be 
asking the user to confirm or deny, or a new file name must be requested.

* When 'name NAME' is used, the log.nnn file is created, but it will miss
to include some information compared with v5.

* Implement missing v5 commands to the maximum extent possible.
