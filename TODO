* Commands white/black/switch don't work. They are supposed to be 
used for icsDrone. However, icsDrone reports to not work for 
GNU Chess 5.02. Neither for v6...

* General cleanups: still some unused code from v5.

* Implement the weak mode.

* Add support for MS Windows.

* icsdrone for Internet

* 'pgnsave filename.pgn' will not replace filename.pgn, but will append to it.
This is not supported by the PGN format. The file must be replaced, may be 
asking the user to confirm or deny, or a new file name must be requested.

* When 'name NAME' is used, the log.nnn file is created, but it will miss
to include some information compared with v5.

* Consider using gnulib for better portability.

* Include PolyGlot's book making capability.

* Include PolyGlot's book merging capability.

* GA/EC venture to make the chess engine stronger.

* Get benefit from multiple-core processors, by sharing search across them.
