The usual procedure should apply. After you have unpacked
the sources, type (in the sources top-level directory)

	./configure
	make

You may also pass several other options such as compiler options
to configure, just type ./configure --help for advice. In particular,
you may experiment with compiler optimization flags, which are added
easily as (assuming you have a bourne-type shell)

CFLAGS="-O3 -ffast-math" ./configure

The build should work with gcc. It should also work with other
compilers.

Test gnuchess by typing

	cd src
	./gnuchess on GNU/Linux / Unix / Mac OS X
	easy
	new
	post
	depth 8
	go
	quit

You should see an 8-ply search. Most machines these
days should finish it within a few seconds. If not,
Control-C out, and do 

	depth 6
	go
	quit

instead.

If you got this far, congratulations.

If you want to install the software in some global directory,
by default /usr/local, become root and type

	make install

If you want to install the sources in some other directory
than /usr/local, replace the first line by

	./configure --prefix=/my/favourite/dir 

You can build an opening book which may enhance the value
of gnuchess quite a lot. In order to do so, get the file
book_1.02.pgn (see doc/README for instructions on how to get it)
and type the following.

	./gnuchess
	book add book_1.02.pgn
	quit

This may take some minutes, depending on the speed of your
machines. The book is quite large (180,000 master games).
If you want a smaller book or you do not want to wait, do the
following instead:

	head -30000 book_1.02.pgn > smallbook.pgn
	./gnuchess
	book add smallbook.pgn
	quit

This will make a much smaller book.

In order to use the book, edit gnuchess.ini and set the value of
'Book' or 'OwnBook' to true.

You can run the program in UCI mode, which makes it externally behave as 
a UCI engine. This is not intended for interactive usage, but for backend 
engine of a UCI-enabled chess graphical interface. Type the following:

	./gnuchess -u
